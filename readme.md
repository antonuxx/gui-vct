# GUI - Visual Configuration Tool (VCT)
Make sure you are in the ```gui-vct``` folder.

**VCT** uses ```npm``` as the libraries and modules manager.
## Install npm dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```
Although this application is not meant to be launched as a standalone application, we have the capability of doing that.
## Launch the standalone application
```bash
$ npm start
```

Each window has a unit testing module that test the interaction with model object.
## Launch individual unit tests
```bash
$ npm run unit_windowName

example:
$ npm run unit_components
```

To run the visual test:
## Launch visual testing
```bash
$ npm test
```
